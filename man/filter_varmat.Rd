\usage{
filter_varmat(
  varmat = NULL,
  variants = c("B.1.1.529", "B.1.1.7", "B.1.351", "B.1.412.7", "B.1.429", "B.1.617.2",

}
\arguments{
\item{varmat}{The result of \code{astronomize()}. If NULL, tries to run \code{astronoimize}.}

\item{variants}{Vector of variant names (must be in \code{rownmaes(varmat)}). Defaults to variants circulating in 2021-2022.}

\item{return_df}{Should the function return a data frame?}

\item{path}{Passed on to \code{astronomize} if \code{varmat} is NULL.}
}
\value{
A variant matrix with fewer rows and columns than \code{varmat}. If \code{return_df}, the columns represent variant names and a \code{mutations} column is added.

}
\details{
After removing some variants, the remaining mutations might not be present in any of the remaining variants. This function will remove mutations that no longer belong to any variants.

Note that return_df will
