\title{Simulate counts and coverage from a variant matrix}
\usage{
simulate_coco(
  varmat,
  rel_counts = NULL,
  censoring = NULL,
  absurd = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{varmat}{The variant matrix, with properly named rows (VOCs) and columns (mutations)}

\item{rel_counts}{(Optional) The relative counts of each VOC (will be censored by coverage). Must be same length as nrow(varmat).}

\item{censoring}{(Optional) The proportion of observations for each mutation. Must be same length as ncol(varmat).}

\item{absurd}{If true, the counts are completely unrelated to the variant proportions. Useful for Monte Carlo estimation.}

\item{verbose}{Print information about the simulation}
}
\value{
A data frame with counts and coverage of the sampled mutations, ready to be used in \code{copt_binom()}.
}
\description{
Simulate counts and coverage from a variant matrix
}
\details{
By default, uses a negative binomial distribution for the counts and uniform censoring for the coverage.
