\title{Ensure mutations are present in both coco and varmat}
\usage{
fuse(coco, varmat)
}
\arguments{
\item{coco}{A data frame with a column labelled \code{mutation}.}

\item{varmat}{Rownames are variants, column names are Mutations.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same columns as coco (possibly fewer rows) and the same columns plus new columns for the variants of concern. The provoc function expects this structure.
}
\description{
Finds the intersection between the mutations present in coco and varmat. Will squash lineages together if the resulting mutation list is too similar (see details).
}
\details{
First, the intersection of the mutations is found.

The columns of varmat are subsetted according to this intersection. If this removes all mutations for any lineage, that lineage is removed from the study (a warning is given if the lineage was a pre-specified voc).

After removing mutations, it's possible that some rows lose their distinctive mutations and become identical. In this case the names of the lineages are pasted together and only one of the rows are kept.

Duplicate mutation names in coco are NOT removed. It is safe to use this function on a data frame that contains multiple samples.
