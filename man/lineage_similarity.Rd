\usage{
lineage_similarity(data, simplify = FALSE, almost = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The result of \code{fuse} or a lineage definition matrix.}
}
\value{
A list of length 4 containing information on which lineages differ by one,
the Jaccard similarity between lineages, which lineages are subsets and almost subsets
of each other. in is_subset and is_almost_subset a value is true if the lineages of the
column name is a subset/almost a subset of the lineages of the row name.
