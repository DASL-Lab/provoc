## 0.5.1: "Lineages of Concern" doesn't have the same ring to it.

- BREAKING CHANGE: All names changed from "variant" to "lineage" (except in "variant of concern").
    - `varmat` has been changed to `lineage_defs` because that's much clearer.
- Minor documentation updates, mainly failed inheritance.
