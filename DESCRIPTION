Description: Given a data frame with columns counts, coverage, and mutation, along with a matrix with rows representing Variants of Concern and columns representing mutations for those variants (entries being 1 if the mutation exists, 0 otherwise), this package provides an optimization routine and a Bayesian model to estimate the proportions of each variant of concern. The Bayesian model requires an installation of JAGS and the runjags R package.
