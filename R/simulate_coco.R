#' Simulate counts and coverage from a lineage definition matrix
#'
#' @param lineage_defs The lineage definition matrix, with properly named rows (VOCs) and columns (mutations)
#' @param rel_counts (Optional) The relative counts of each VOC (will be censored by coverage). Must be same length as nrow(lineage_defs).
#' @param censoring (Optional) The proportion of observations for each mutation. Must be same length as ncol(lineage_defs).
#' @param verbose Print information about the simulation
#' @param absurd If true, the counts are completely unrelated to the lineage proportions. Useful for Monte Carlo estimation.
#'
#' @return A data frame with counts and coverage of the sampled mutations, ready to be used in \code{copt_binom()}.
#' @export
#'
#' @details By default, uses a negative binomial distribution for the counts and uniform censoring for the coverage.
