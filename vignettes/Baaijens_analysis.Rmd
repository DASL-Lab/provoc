# Introduction

Baaijens et al. collected wastewater sequencing data as part of a study to predict lineage abundance. I reanalyse the data here.



# Data Processing

The data have been processed according to my own pipeline ([Data-Treatment-Plant](https://github.com/DASL-Lab/data-treatment-plant), which is based on [GromStole](https://github.com/PoonLab/gromstole)).

In particular, every mutation that was observed with at least 20% frequency was included in all samples. For samples where the mutation was not present, I looked up the coverage in the coverage files. This is not relevant for ProVoC, since it only looks at a single sample at a time. It does, however, ensure that each sample is based on the same information. 

# Naive Analysis

Let's try some linear modelling approaches!

```{r}
library(provoc)
varmat <- astronomize()
baaijens_lineages <- c("B.1.1.7", "B.1.427",
    "B.1.429", "B.1.526")
varmat <- varmat[baaijens_lineages, ]

data(Baaijens)
baaijens1 <- Baaijens[Baaijens$date == "2021-01-11", ]
baaijens1$mutation <- parse_mutations(baaijens1$label)
fused <- fuse(baaijens1, varmat, verbose = FALSE)

rhs <- paste0("-1 + var_",
    paste(baaijens_lineages, collapse = " + var_"))

lmcoef <- coef(lm(
    paste0("frequency ~ ", rhs),
    data = fused
))

data.frame(
        lineage = baaijens_lineages,
        lm = round(unname(lmcoef), 3)) |>
    knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

Oooh that's bad! Negative estimates??? That's not possible. 

# ProVoC

ProVoC ensures that estimates are positive and that their sum is less than or equal to 1.

```{R}
res <- provoc(fused = fused)
data.frame(
        lineage = baaijens_lineages,
        lm = round(unname(lmcoef), 3),
        provoc = round(res$rho, 3)) |>
    knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

ProVoC is set up to handle multiple samples and provide output convenient for `ggplot2`. As of this writing, it uses a column labelled "`sample`" and applies the model separately to each unique value in that column. It will also retain any information that is constant within each sample - for example, the date or location.

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
library(lubridate)
Baaijens$mutation <- parse_mutations(Baaijens$label)
Baaijens$sample <- Baaijens$sra
fused <- fuse(Baaijens, varmat)
res <- provoc(fused = fused)

ggplot(res) +
    aes(x = ymd(date), y = rho) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(~ variant) +
    scale_x_date() +
    labs(x = "Date", y = "Proportion in Sample",
        title = "ProVoC applied to many samples")
```
