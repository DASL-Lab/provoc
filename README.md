PROportions of Variants of Concern using counts, coverage, and a variant
matrix.

Builds and diagnoses a model based on:

- Counts: The number of times a given mutation was observed.
- Coverage: The number of times the position of a given variant was
  read.
- Mutation names: whatever format you want, as long as they match the
  names in the Variant Matrix.
- Variant Matrix: A matrix where the row names are variants, the column
  names are mutations, and the entries are 1 if the row variant has the
  column mutation and 0 otherwise.
  - For example: Usher Barcodes
  - All current methods accept fractional entries.

# Usage

There are two steps to using this software: create the mutation
definitions and run the model(s).

If not specified, the mutation definitions uses hardcoded definitions
from the
[cov-lineages/constellations](https://github.com/cov-lineages/constellations)
repo, which contains the representative mutations that were identified
by the PANGO team. The mutation definitions must have names that match
what exists in the data.

``` r
#library(provoc)
devtools::load_all()
```

``` r
data(Baaijens)
b1 <- Baaijens [Baaijens$sra == Baaijens$sra[1], ]
b1$mutation <- parse_mutations(b1$label)

head(b1[, c("count", "coverage", "mutation", "label")])
```

The main fitting function is designed to mimic `glm()`, with formula
notation that emphasizes the connection to binomial GLM models. The
`bootstrap_samples` argument is optional, and is used to calculate
confidence intervals and correlation of the parameters.

``` r
res <- provoc(
    formula = count / coverage ~ B.1.1.7 + B.1.429 + B.1.617.2 + 
        B.1.427 + AY.4 + P.1,
    data = b1,
    bootstrap_samples = 100)
res
```

    Call: count/coverage ~ B.1.1.7 + B.1.429 + B.1.617.2 + B.1.427 + AY.4 + 
        P.1

We have created a class for `provoc` objects with convenient methods.
For example, plotting the results is achieved as follows:

``` r
plot(res)
```

![](README_files/figure-commonmark/one-sample-res-base-1.png)

We use the convention of
[`autoplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/autoplot.html) as
a function that creates a `ggplot2` plot based on a particular type of
data. This allows for all of `ggplot2`’s fanciness on top of a pre-made
plot.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
autoplot(res) +
    theme_bw() +

Note the “`by`” argument below. This tells `provoc()` to fit the model
separately to each sample defined by the `by` column. Since there are 30
samples, the model takes a while to run, hence why there are no
bootstrap samples here.

``` r
system.time(
    res <- provoc(
        formula = count / coverage ~ B.1.1.7 + B.1.429 + B.1.617.2 +

The plotting functions above work as expected.

``` r
plot(res)
```

![](README_files/figure-commonmark/multi-sample-res-base-1.png)

``` r
plot_resids(res)
```

![](README_files/figure-commonmark/multi-sample-resid-base-1.png)

``` r
autoplot(res)
```

![](README_files/figure-commonmark/multi-sample-res-ggplot-1.png)

In addition, we’ve added special functionality for data with a “date”
column:

``` r
theme_set(theme_bw())
res$date <- lubridate::ymd(res$date)
autoplot(res, date_col = "date")
```

![](README_files/figure-commonmark/multi-date-res-ggplot-1.png)

Since `autoplot()` returns a `ggplot2` object, you can use all your
knowledge of ggplot2:

``` r
autoplot(res, date_col = "date") +
    facet_wrap(~ variant, nrow = 1) +
    labs(title = "Proportions of Lineages over Time") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

![](README_files/figure-commonmark/faceting-1.png)

Finally, the residual plot still works (although it’s a bunch of samples
stuffed into one plot, so its use is limited.)

``` r
plot_resids(res)
```

![](README_files/figure-commonmark/multi-sample-resid-plot-1.png)

## Searching for Different Variants

``` r
library(patchwork)
res_with <- provoc(cbind(count, coverage) ~ B.1.1.7 + B.1.429 + B.1.617.2 + B.1.427,
    data = b2, by = "sra",
    verbose = FALSE, bootstrap_samples = 0)
res_with$date <- lubridate::ymd(res_with$date)

res_without <- provoc(cbind(count, coverage) ~ B.1.429 + B.1.617.2 + B.1.427,
    data = b2, by = "sra",
    verbose = FALSE, bootstrap_samples = 0)
res_without$date <- lubridate::ymd(res_without$date)

g_with <- autoplot(res_with, date_col = "date") +
    scale_fill_manual(values = 2:5)
g_without <- autoplot(res_without, date_col = "date") +
    scale_fill_manual(values = 3:5)

g_with / g_without
```

![](README_files/figure-commonmark/with-without-1.png)

Notice two important points:

1.  Since proportions can’t sum to greater than one, including B.1.1.7
    when it should be excluded means it will take away from the other
    lineages!
    - Erroneously **increasing** one means **decreasing** true lineages.
2.  Due to shared mutations, excluding B.1.1.7 when it should be
    included means other lineages increase to make up for it.
    - Erroneously **decreasing** one means **increasing** other
      lineages.

`provoc` also accepts the `~ .` formula notation. This is useful if you
want to manipulate the lineages in the lineage definitions matrix, which
is easier programmatically than dealing with formulae in R. The
`filter_variants()` function will remove mutations that are not present
in any of the remaining lineages.

``` r
mutation_defs <- provoc::usher_barcodes(path = "working") |>
    filter_variants(c("B.1.1.7", "B.1.617.2", "B.1.427",
        "B.1.429", "AY.4", "BA.4", "BA.5"))
```

With these definitions, we can just use all of them:

``` r
res_all <- provoc(count / coverage ~ ., data = b1, 
    bootstrap_samples = 0,
    mutation_defs = mutation_defs)

plot_variants(res_all)
```

  - [ ] Tools to investigate the effect of different lineage
    definitions.
  - [ ] Interface with the LAPIS API (cov-spectrum data) to build
    mutation definitions on the fly.
- Medium future

    advantage of the diagnostics.
  - [ ] Allow list arguments to fit several different models/mutation
    definitions in one call
  - [ ] Interactive (`shiny`) applications for exploring lineage
    definition matrices
